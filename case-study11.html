                RMIT G’Day is a translation app designed for RMIT students, targeted at international
students to assist them with their education and the Australian lifestyle.The app has
two important features, the translation features that give the students three different
ways to translate any piece of information and adding events as an option to interact
with other students will not only improve confidence but will also enable a healthy social
life. The app also allows students to be able to quickly scan through slang and understand
its usage with examples. The outcome of this app is to make international students feel
comfortable and create a culturally diverse environment at RMIT.

With the key factor of designing it for students to translate, we wanted to create a brand
new experience for them to be able to use. Some approaches were, such as the use of a
machine like google home or simply creating a translation tool feature to a more familiar
platform; mobile phones.

                    <h3>Survey</h3>
                  <p class="big-text">Based on the survey conducted we were able to understand better the student's
requirements, their experiences:</p>
                    <ul class="ponk3" >
<li> 55 % of the participants favored using an app for
translation over desktop websites, based on this we were able to decide to create
a mobile app.</li>
<li>Over 45 % of students felt neutral about being involved and connected
with RMIT. This was important as we're able to know that adding a feature to push
students to socialize would sit well with the current mindset of international students
of RMIT.</li>
<li>With equal learning styles with Visual and Text responses, we were able to
understand that the features of the app must-have tools to cater to both visual and
verbal learners.</li>
<li> With 45 % of students wanting to learn more about Australian Culture
and 55% of students agreeing they faced difficulties in understanding the Australian
slangs, helped us move further with adding a feature to help students understand the
meanings and usage of Australian slangs.</li></ul>

                  <p class="big-text">We conducted two face to face interviews with two RMIT international students and
were able to find that students prefer to learn languages through social interaction and
speaking with others. The interview also gave the understanding that students learn
based on their interest in the language or culture.</p>

                  <p class="big-text">Based on the primary research we conducted, we found that many international students
feel left out and demotivated to interact with other students, often this led them to turn
to translation apps and their needs were different from general translation they found
many features missing. This also influenced them to keep using translation apps to fulfill
short term goals, instead of putting efforts into actually learning a new language.</p>

    <p  class="big-text">Based on the research conducted we were able to decide the features, platform, and
type of app we will be creating. As we discovered that most of the students prefer visual
and textbased learning the addition of these tools was important. Also knowing the
participation of students in RMIT events was neutral it was an opportunity that we will
use to add events section in the app to encourage more social interaction that will lead
to an immersion into the Australian culture. Helping students to improve their vocabulary.
We see this to be a morale and motivating factor for students to not only have access to a
translation app but also to socialize with peers with more ease which gave rise to the
addition of “What's happening RMIT”. The next aspect was the Australian Slangs which
most international students faced trouble in understanding and finding ways to know the
meaning, this leads to the idea of adding an Australian slang section or a library with the
most commonly used slangs and their meanings.</p>

    <h2  style="text-align: center"class="big-text ">Project Limitations</h2>
                    
 <p  class="big-text">The main limitation that will display in further stages is the accuracy of the translations , it differs from perception
from people to people and cultural usage as well. We feel the expansion option will avoid this by suggesting
popular usages of terms. The accents of people will also be an aspect to focus on. Other limitations of the project
were to identify the methods of translation , the options available of translations is wide , the inclusion of an extension
into other apps , the use of the tool without the app in place were few things we wanted to revolve around , however
making it streamlined to RMIT studentshelped us keep the project in realistic terms.</p>
    <h2 style="text-align: center" class="big-text ">Project Outcomes & Insights</h2>
                    
 <p  class="big-text">The solution was to create an translation app for the International students of RMIT to translate and also create
an outlet to culturally immerse them using social events and clubs of RMIT . We feel this solution will cater and sit
well because the scope of this app is beyond just translation of information but also acting as a tool to make students
to not just feel but be part of the community .Most of the users do thier day to day tasks on their phone made it easier
to create an app as almost everyone has access to a smart phone, creating a tool to learn a language based on daily
tasks seemed to be burden for students making it seem like a course to do would just push them away from learning .
Our brainstromed idea of involving events and clubs seemed realistic and simple solution to make students interested
     in leanring a language , help improve social circle ,and understand the culture.</p></div>
